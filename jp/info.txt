/movies/ - https://wii.com/jp/movies/
i was looking around and decided to try this and the index showed up, sadly no movies are viewable as it seems to be deleted and redirects to the main page.
but we have names of movies now!!!
the directories still exist, the movies dont exist anymore causing it go show a 404 ig..


(this is a mix of beta wii movies/videos & after release videos (ex the demae video name), thats why im including it here since its also betawii content)
